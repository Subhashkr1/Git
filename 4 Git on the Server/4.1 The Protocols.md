# Git Protocols

Git can transfer data using four protocols: **Local**, **HTTP**, **SSH**, and **Git**. Here is a short overview of each:

## Local Protocol
- **Usage:** Transfers data between repositories on the same host.
- **Command Example:**
  ```
  git clone /srv/git/project.git
  git clone file:///srv/git/project.git
  ```
- **Pros:**
  - Simple to set up with shared filesystems.
  - Fast if access to data is quick.
- **Cons:**
  - Hard to access from multiple locations.
  - Less secure and prone to accidental damage.

## HTTP Protocols
### Smart HTTP
- **Usage:** Modern, supports authentication and encryption over HTTPS.
- **Command Example:**
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```
- **Pros:**
  - Single URL for all access.
  - Easy to authenticate with username and password.
  - Works well behind corporate firewalls.
- **Cons:**
  - Slightly tricky to set up.

### Dumb HTTP
- **Usage:** Simple, read-only access by serving bare repositories as static files.
- **Command Example:**
  ```
  git clone https://example.com/repo.git
  ```
- **Pros:** Easy to set up.
- **Cons:** Inefficient for large repositories.

## SSH Protocol
- **Usage:** Secure and authenticated transfers over SSH.
- **Command Example:**
  ```
  git clone ssh://user@server/project.git
  git clone user@server:project.git
  ```
- **Pros:**
  - Secure and efficient.
  - Easy to set up with SSH.
- **Cons:**
  - No anonymous access.
  - Requires SSH access for all users.

## Git Protocol
- **Usage:** Fast, unauthenticated data transfer over port 9418.
- **Command Example:**
  ```
  git clone git://example.com/project.git
  ```
- **Pros:** Fast for public projects with no authentication.
- **Cons:**
  - No encryption or authentication.
  - Vulnerable to attacks.
  - Difficult to set up (requires `git-daemon`).
