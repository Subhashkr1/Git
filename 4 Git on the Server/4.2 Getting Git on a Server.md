# Getting Git on a Server

Setting up a Git service on your server is simple. Below are the basic steps to get started, focusing on a Linux-based server. These steps can also work on macOS or Windows with some adjustments.

## Setting Up a Bare Repository

1. Export an existing repository into a new bare repository using the `--bare` option:
   ```bash
   $ git clone --bare my_project my_project.git
   Cloning into bare repository 'my_project.git'...
   done.
   ```
   
2. Alternatively, copy the `.git` folder manually:
   ```bash
   $ cp -Rf my_project/.git my_project.git
   ```

   This creates a bare repository, which is a Git repository without a working directory.

## Hosting the Repository on a Server

1. Copy the bare repository to the server:
   ```bash
   $ scp -r my_project.git user@git.example.com:/srv/git
   ```

2. Users with SSH access can clone the repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone user@git.example.com:/srv/git/my_project.git
   ```

3. To allow push access for users with write permissions, set up the repository as shared:
   ```bash
   $ ssh user@git.example.com
   $ cd /srv/git/my_project.git
   $ git init --bare --shared
   ```

## Simple Git Server Setup

For a basic Git server:
- Add SSH-accessible accounts on your server.
- Place bare repositories in a shared location.

## Advanced Setups

### Small Teams
For small teams, SSH access is often the easiest:
- Grant access using normal filesystem permissions.
- For more complex setups, create a single `git` user and:
  - Collect team members' SSH public keys.
  - Add them to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of the `git` user.

### Larger Teams
Use centralized authentication (e.g., LDAP) to manage SSH access.

## Next Steps
Expand your setup to:
- Add public read access.
- Set up web UIs.
- Simplify user management.

For small private projects, all you need is an SSH server and a bare repository. Start simple, then scale as needed.
