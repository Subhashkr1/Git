# Generating Your SSH Public Key

Many Git servers use SSH public keys for authentication. Here's how to generate one if you don't already have it.

## Check for Existing SSH Key

1. Look for existing keys in the `~/.ssh` directory:
   ```bash
   $ cd ~/.ssh
   $ ls
   ```
   
   You’re looking for files like `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`. The `.pub` file is your public key, and the other is your private key.

2. If no keys are found, or if the `~/.ssh` directory doesn’t exist, proceed to generate a new key.

## Generate a New SSH Key

1. Run the `ssh-keygen` command:
   ```bash
   $ ssh-keygen -o
   Generating public/private rsa key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
   ```

2. Press **Enter** to confirm the default file location.

3. Enter a passphrase (optional but recommended) and confirm it. This passphrase adds an extra layer of security.

   Output example:
   ```
   Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
   Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
   ```

## Share Your Public Key

1. Copy the contents of the `.pub` file:
   ```bash
   $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

2. Share the public key (e.g., email it) with the server administrator.

   Example public key format:
   ```
   ssh-rsa AAAAB3...user@hostname
   ```
