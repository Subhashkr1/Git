# Recording Changes to the Repository

Now that you have a Git repository, you can start tracking changes. Files in your working directory can be:

- **Tracked**: Files already in the repository or staged for commit.
- **Untracked**: New files not added to Git yet.

## Checking the Status
Use `git status` to see the state of your files. Example:

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This means no changes have been made yet.

## Adding New Files
To start tracking a new file:

```bash
$ git add <filename>
```

For example:

```bash
$ git add README
$ git status
Changes to be committed:
  new file: README
```

The file is now staged and ready to commit.

## Staging Changes
To stage modified files, use:

```bash
$ git add <filename>
```

Example:

```bash
$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
Changes to be committed:
  modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
```

If you make further changes, run `git add` again to update the staged version.

## Short Status
For a compact view of changes, use:

```bash
$ git status -s
```

Output example:

```bash
 M README
MM Rakefile
A  lib/git.rb
?? LICENSE.txt
```

- `??` = Untracked files
- `A` = Staged new files
- `M` = Modified files (staged or unstaged)

## Ignoring Files
Create a `.gitignore` file to tell Git which files to ignore. Example:

```bash
# Ignore all `.o` and `.a` files
*.[oa]
# Ignore temporary files
*~
```

Rules:

- Lines starting with `#` are comments.
- `*` matches multiple characters.
- `/` at the start avoids recursion.
- `!` negates patterns.

### Example `.gitignore`

```bash
# Ignore all `.a` files
*.a
# Track `lib.a` even if `.a` files are ignored
!lib.a
# Ignore `TODO` in the root directory
/TODO
# Ignore everything in `build/`
build/
# Ignore `.txt` files in `doc/`, but not subdirectories
/doc/*.txt
# Ignore `.pdf` files in `doc/` and its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf
```

## Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes

If `git status` feels too vague, you can use `git diff` to see exact changes made to your files. This helps answer:

- What have you changed but not staged?
- What have you staged for the next commit?

### Example Workflow

1. **Edit and Stage Files:**
   - Edit `README` and stage it.
   - Edit `CONTRIBUTING.md` without staging it.

   ```bash
   $ git status
   On branch master
   Changes to be committed:
     modified: README
   Changes not staged for commit:
     modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
   ```

2. **View Unstaged Changes:**
   ```bash
   $ git diff
   ```
   This shows differences between your working directory and the staging area.

3. **View Staged Changes:**
   ```bash
   $ git diff --staged
   ```
   This compares staged changes to the last commit.

### Additional Examples

- After staging `CONTRIBUTING.md` and making more edits:

  ```bash
  $ git diff
  ```
  Shows unstaged changes.

  ```bash
  $ git diff --cached
  ```
  Shows staged changes.

### Using External Tools

Run `git difftool` to view changes in a graphical or external diff viewer. Use `git difftool --tool-help` to see available tools.

### Committing Your Changes

1. Commit staged changes:
   ```bash
   $ git commit
   ```
   This opens your editor to write a commit message.

2. Inline commit message:
   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Fix README formatting"
   ```

3. Skip staging with `-a`:
   ```bash
   $ git commit -a -m "Update benchmarks"
   ```

### Removing Files

1. Remove and stage a file:
   ```bash
   $ git rm filename
   ```

2. Keep the file in your working directory but untrack it:
   ```bash
   $ git rm --cached filename
   ```

### Moving Files

1. Rename a file:
   ```bash
   $ git mv old_name new_name
   ```

   This is equivalent to:
   ```bash
   $ mv old_name new_name
   $ git rm old_name
   $ git add new_name
   ```
