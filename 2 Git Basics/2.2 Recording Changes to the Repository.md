# Recording Changes to the Repository

Now that you have a Git repository, you can start tracking changes. Files in your working directory can be:

- **Tracked**: Files already in the repository or staged for commit.
- **Untracked**: New files not added to Git yet.

## Checking the Status
Use `git status` to see the state of your files. Example:

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This means no changes have been made yet.

## Adding New Files
To start tracking a new file:

```bash
$ git add <filename>
```

For example:

```bash
$ git add README
$ git status
Changes to be committed:
  new file: README
```

The file is now staged and ready to commit.

## Staging Changes
To stage modified files, use:

```bash
$ git add <filename>
```

Example:

```bash
$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
Changes to be committed:
  modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
```

If you make further changes, run `git add` again to update the staged version.

## Short Status
For a compact view of changes, use:

```bash
$ git status -s
```

Output example:

```bash
 M README
MM Rakefile
A  lib/git.rb
?? LICENSE.txt
```

- `??` = Untracked files
- `A` = Staged new files
- `M` = Modified files (staged or unstaged)

## Ignoring Files
Create a `.gitignore` file to tell Git which files to ignore. Example:

```bash
# Ignore all `.o` and `.a` files
*.[oa]
# Ignore temporary files
*~
```

Rules:

- Lines starting with `#` are comments.
- `*` matches multiple characters.
- `/` at the start avoids recursion.
- `!` negates patterns.

### Example `.gitignore`

```bash
# Ignore all `.a` files
*.a
# Track `lib.a` even if `.a` files are ignored
!lib.a
# Ignore `TODO` in the root directory
/TODO
# Ignore everything in `build/`
build/
# Ignore `.txt` files in `doc/`, but not subdirectories
/doc/*.txt
# Ignore `.pdf` files in `doc/` and its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf
```
