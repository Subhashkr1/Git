# Undoing Things in Git

## Undoing Commits

Sometimes, you may commit too early or forget to add files. To redo a commit:

1. Make the additional changes you forgot.
2. Stage them.
3. Use the `--amend` option:
   ```bash
   git commit --amend
   ```
   This overwrites the previous commit, including the commit message if edited.

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git add forgotten_file
git commit --amend
```

**Note:** Only amend commits that are local and not yet pushed.

## Unstaging a Staged File

If you accidentally stage a file and want to unstage it:

1. Use `git status` to see the staged files.
2. Unstage using:
   ```bash
   git reset HEAD <file>
   ```

Example:
```bash
git add *
git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md
```
This unstages the file but keeps your changes in the working directory.

## Unmodifying a Modified File

To discard changes to a file and revert it to the last committed version:

1. Use `git status` to check the modified files.
2. Discard changes using:
   ```bash
   git checkout -- <file>
   ```

Example:
```bash
git checkout -- CONTRIBUTING.md
```
**Warning:** This command will erase local changes to the file.

## Using `git restore`

Git 2.23.0 introduced `git restore` as an alternative to `git reset` and `git checkout` for undo operations.

### Unstaging a Staged File with `git restore`

1. Use `git status` to see the staged files.
2. Unstage using:
   ```bash
   git restore --staged <file>
   ```

Example:
```bash
git add *
git restore --staged CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### Unmodifying a Modified File with `git restore`

To discard changes:

1. Use `git status` to check modified files.
2. Discard changes using:
   ```bash
   git restore <file>
   ```

Example:
```bash
git restore CONTRIBUTING.md
```
**Warning:** This will erase unsaved changes.

## Important Notes

- **Be careful with `git reset` and `git restore` commands, as they can result in loss of uncommitted changes.**
- Committed changes are generally recoverable. Uncommitted changes, however, may be lost permanently.
