# The Command Line

Git can be used in a variety of ways, including through:

- **Command-line tools** (the original and most comprehensive method).
- **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**, which offer varying levels of Git functionality.

For this guide, we will focus on using **Git on the command line**. Here's why:

## Why Use the Command Line?

1. **Complete Functionality**:  
   - The command line provides access to all Git commands.  
   - GUIs often simplify Git usage by implementing only a subset of its full functionality.

2. **Versatility**:  
   - Once you understand the command-line interface, you can easily transition to using GUIs if desired.  
   - The reverse is not necessarily true, as GUIs may abstract or limit certain functionalities.

3. **Universal Availability**:  
   - All Git users will have the command-line tools installed, regardless of platform.  
   - This ensures a consistent experience across macOS, Windows, and Linux.
