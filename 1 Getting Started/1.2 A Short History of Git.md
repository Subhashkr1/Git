# A Short History of Git

As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy.

The **Linux kernel** is an open-source software project of considerable scope. During its early years (1991â€“2002), changes to the software were shared as patches and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project started using a proprietary Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) called **BitKeeper**.

In 2005, the relationship between the Linux kernel community and the commercial company behind BitKeeper broke down, leading to the revocation of the tool's free-of-charge status. This conflict prompted the Linux development community, spearheaded by **Linus Torvalds** (the creator of Linux), to develop their own tool. They incorporated lessons learned from BitKeeper and established several goals for their new system:

- **Speed**
- **Simple design**
- **Strong support for non-linear development** (thousands of parallel branches)
- **Fully distributed**
- **Efficiency for large projects** (e.g., the Linux kernel)

Since its creation in 2005, **Git** has evolved into a mature and widely-used version control system. It remains:

- **Amazingly fast**.
- **Efficient with large projects**.
- Equipped with an **incredible branching system** for non-linear development.

Git's design principles and features make it a cornerstone of modern software development.
