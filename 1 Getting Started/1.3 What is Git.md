# What is Git?

Git is a powerful **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** used for tracking changes in files and coordinating work among developers. To use Git effectively, it helps to understand its core concepts and how it differs from other version control systems like CVS, Subversion, or Perforce.

## Snapshots, Not Differences

Unlike other VCSs that store data as a series of changes (delta-based version control), Git stores data as a **series of snapshots** of the project. 

- Each commit in Git is like a **photo of your entire project at a specific moment**.
- If a file hasn’t changed, Git doesn’t duplicate it — it simply links to the previous identical file.

This approach makes Git act more like a **mini filesystem** with powerful tools, rather than a simple VCS.

## Nearly Every Operation is Local

Git performs almost all operations locally, using the complete project history stored on your disk. 

- **Speed**: Operations like viewing project history or differences are instantaneous because no network requests are required.
- **Offline Capability**: You can work offline, commit changes, and push them later when connected. This is in stark contrast to systems like Subversion or Perforce, which rely heavily on server connections.

## Git Has Integrity

Git ensures **data integrity** through checksums, making it impossible to alter files without detection.

- Git uses **SHA-1 hashes** to identify and reference files and directories.
- Example of a SHA-1 hash: `24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373`.

Git’s integrity mechanism guarantees that no data is lost or corrupted during operations.

## Git Generally Only Adds Data

Git operations generally **add data** to the database rather than delete or overwrite it. 

- Once you commit a snapshot, it is difficult to lose it, especially if you push it to a remote repository.
- This makes experimenting safe, as most changes can be undone.

## The Three States of Git

Git files exist in one of three states:

1. **Modified**: The file has been changed but not yet staged.
2. **Staged**: The file has been marked to be included in the next commit.
3. **Committed**: The file’s data is safely stored in the Git database.

## The Three Main Sections of a Git Project

1. **Working Tree**:  
   - A single checkout of one version of the project.  
   - Files here are pulled from the Git database and placed on your disk for modification.

2. **Staging Area**:  
   - Also known as the "index."  
   - Temporarily stores changes you want to include in your next commit.

3. **Git Directory**:  
   - The repository where Git stores metadata and the object database for your project.  
   - This is the most crucial part of Git.

## Basic Git Workflow

1. **Modify files** in your working tree.  
2. **Stage changes** you want to include in the next commit.  
3. **Commit the changes**, saving a snapshot to the Git directory.

By understanding these fundamental concepts, you’ll be better equipped to use Git effectively and avoid confusion as you work on projects.
