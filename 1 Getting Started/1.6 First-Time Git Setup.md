# First-Time Git Setup

Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment. You should only need to perform these steps once on any given computer; they’ll persist through upgrades. You can also change them at any time by rerunning the commands.

Git comes with a tool called `git config` that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variables can be stored in three different places:

1. **`[path]/etc/gitconfig` file**: Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories. Use the `--system` option to read and write to this file. Superuser privilege is required to modify it.
2. **`~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config` file**: Contains values specific to you, the user. Use the `--global` option to read and write to this file. It affects all repositories on your system.
3. **`config` file in the Git directory (`.git/config`)**: Contains values specific to the current repository. Use the `--local` option to read and write to this file. This is the default option when inside a repository.

Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in `.git/config` override those in `[path]/etc/gitconfig`.

### On Windows Systems
- Git looks for the `.gitconfig` file in the `$HOME` directory (e.g., `C:\Users\$USER`).
- Git also looks for `[path]/etc/gitconfig` relative to the MSys root, where Git is installed.
- For Git 2.x and later, there is a system-level config file at:
  - Windows XP: `C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Git\config`
  - Windows Vista and newer: `C:\ProgramData\Git\config`

You can view all your settings and their sources using:
```bash
$ git config --list --show-origin
```

## Setting Your Identity
The first step is to set your user name and email address. Every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you create.
```bash
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```
- Use the `--global` option to set these values for all repositories on the system.
- To override globally set values for a specific repository, omit the `--global` option when running the commands within that repository.

## Configuring Your Editor
Set the default text editor that Git will use when prompting for commit messages. If not configured, Git uses the system’s default editor.

To use Emacs:
```bash
$ git config --global core.editor emacs
```

On Windows, specify the full path to the editor’s executable file. For Notepad++:
```bash
$ git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"
```

### Popular Editors
- Vim, Emacs, and Notepad++ are commonly used by developers.
- Find specific instructions for your favorite editor in the `git config core.editor` documentation.

### Troubleshooting
Incorrect editor configuration can result in confusing states, such as prematurely terminated Git operations during edits.

## Setting the Default Branch Name
By default, Git creates a branch called `master` for new repositories. Starting with Git 2.28, you can set a custom default branch name:
```bash
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

## Checking Your Configuration
List all configuration settings Git can find:
```bash
$ git config --list
```
Example output:
```
user.name=John Doe
user.email=johndoe@example.com
color.status=auto
color.branch=auto
color.interactive=auto
color.diff=auto
```

Keys may appear more than once, as Git reads from multiple configuration files. The last value read overrides previous ones.

Check the value of a specific key:
```bash
$ git config user.name
John Doe
```

Query the origin of a specific value:
```bash
$ git config --show-origin rerere.autoUpdate
file:/home/johndoe/.gitconfig false
