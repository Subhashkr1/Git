# Basic Branching and Merging

## Workflow Example
1. Work on your website.
2. Create a branch for a new feature or user story.
3. Do some work in the new branch.

If a critical issue arises:
1. Switch to the production branch.
2. Create a branch for the hotfix.
3. Test the fix, merge it into production, and push.
4. Switch back to the original branch and continue work.

## Basic Branching
1. To create and switch to a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch_name
   ```
   Equivalent to:
   ```bash
   git branch branch_name
   git checkout branch_name
   ```

2. Work on the branch and commit changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -a -m 'Commit message'
   ```

3. Switch back to the production branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```

4. Create a hotfix branch, apply fixes, and commit:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix
   git commit -a -m 'Hotfix message'
   ```

5. Merge the hotfix branch into the production branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge hotfix
   ```

6. Delete the hotfix branch after merging:
   ```bash
   git branch -d hotfix
   ```

7. Return to your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout branch_name
   ```

## Basic Merging
1. When your feature branch is ready to merge:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge branch_name
   ```

2. If a "fast-forward" merge occurs, Git moves the branch pointer forward without creating a new commit.
3. If the branches have diverged, Git performs a three-way merge and creates a merge commit.

## Merge Conflicts
1. If conflicts occur during a merge:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   Resolve conflicts manually in files marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.

2. After resolving conflicts, mark them as resolved:
   ```bash
   git add conflicted_file
   ```

3. Finalize the merge:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

4. Use a merge tool for assistance:
   ```bash
   git mergetool
   ```

By following these steps, you can manage branching, merging, and resolving conflicts effectively.
