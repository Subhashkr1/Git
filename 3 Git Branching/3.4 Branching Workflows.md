# Branching Workflows

With the basics of branching and merging in place, here are common workflows to help you structure your development process.

## Long-Running Branches
Git's simple three-way merge allows for multiple long-running branches. You can use these branches for different stages of your development cycle:

- **Master Branch:** Contains stable, production-ready code.
- **Develop Branch:** Used for integrating and testing new features before merging into master.
- **Topic Branches:** Short-lived branches for specific features or fixes. Once completed and tested, these are merged into develop or master.

### Progressive Stability
Branches can be thought of as silos of work:
- New work starts in feature or topic branches.
- Tested work moves to the develop branch.
- Stable work is merged into the master branch.

Larger projects may include additional branches like `proposed` or `pu` (proposed updates) for experimental changes.

## Topic Branches
Topic branches are short-lived and focused on specific tasks. They allow for:
- Clear isolation of work.
- Easier context-switching.
- Clean commit histories for code reviews.

### Example Workflow
1. Start work on the master branch.
2. Create a topic branch for an issue (e.g., `iss91`).
3. Test different approaches by creating sub-branches (e.g., `iss91v2`).
4. Merge the preferred solution back into master.

You can discard unused branches (e.g., `iss91`) after merging the relevant work.

## Local Branching
Remember, all branching and merging are local to your Git repository until you push changes to the remote server.
