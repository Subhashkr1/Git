# Rebasing in Git

In Git, rebasing is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another, offering an alternative to merging. It rewrites the commit history, creating a cleaner and linear timeline.

## What is Rebasing?
Rebasing takes the changes made in one branch and replays them on top of another branch. Unlike merging, which combines branches by creating a merge commit, rebasing integrates changes sequentially.

### Example: Basic Rebase
1. Check out the branch you want to rebase:
   ```bash
   git checkout experiment
   git rebase master
   ```
2. This moves the changes from the `experiment` branch and applies them on top of `master`.

3. To finalize, merge it back into `master` with:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge experiment
   ```

This results in a cleaner history without a merge commit.

## Advantages of Rebasing
- **Clean History:** Provides a linear and easy-to-read commit timeline.
- **Simplified Collaboration:** Helps maintain a clean commit history when contributing to projects.

## When to Avoid Rebasing
- **Avoid rebasing commits shared with others.** Rebasing rewrites history, causing conflicts for collaborators who have already pulled the old commits.
- **Be cautious with public branches.** Use rebasing only on private or feature branches to avoid disrupting shared repositories.

### Example: Avoid Public Rebases
If you’ve pushed commits and someone else pulls them, rebasing will create duplicate commits, confusing the history.

## Rebase vs. Merge
| Feature             | Merge                      | Rebase                     |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **History**         | Preserves all branches     | Linear history             |
| **Usage**           | Combines work with a merge commit | Replays changes sequentially |
| **Conflict Risk**   | Low after push             | High if rebased after push |

### Best Practices
- Use `rebase` for cleaning up local commits before sharing.
- Use `merge` for integrating branches in shared repositories.

### Command Cheat Sheet
- **Rebase a branch:**
  ```bash
  git rebase <base-branch>
  ```
- **Rebase with —onto:**
  ```bash
  git rebase --onto <new-base> <upstream-branch> <topic-branch>
  ```
- **Pull with rebase:**
  ```bash
  git pull --rebase
  ```
- **Set rebase as default for pull:**
  ```bash
  git config --global pull.rebase true
  ```

## Conclusion
Rebasing is a powerful tool for maintaining a clean and linear commit history. However, it’s crucial to use it wisely and avoid rebasing commits that others might depend on. Use rebasing for local changes and merging for shared branches to balance history clarity and collaboration efficiency.
