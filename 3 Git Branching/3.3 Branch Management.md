# Branch Management

Now that youâ€™ve created, merged, and deleted some branches, here are some useful tools for managing branches effectively.

## Viewing Branches
The `git branch` command does more than just create and delete branches. Running it without arguments lists your current branches:

```bash
$ git branch
  iss53
* master
  testing
```
- The `*` indicates the branch currently checked out (HEAD points to it). Any new commits will move this branch forward.

To see the last commit on each branch, use:

```bash
$ git branch -v
  iss53    93b412c Fix javascript issue
* master   7a98805 Merge branch 'iss53'
  testing  782fd34 Add scott to the author list in the readme
```

## Merged and Unmerged Branches
Use the `--merged` option to list branches already merged into the current branch:

```bash
$ git branch --merged
  iss53
* master
```
These branches (without `*`) can be safely deleted using:

```bash
$ git branch -d iss53
```

To see branches with unmerged work:

```bash
$ git branch --no-merged
  testing
```
Trying to delete an unmerged branch with `-d` will fail. Use `-D` to force delete:

```bash
$ git branch -D testing
```

## Renaming a Branch
Rename a local branch using:

```bash
$ git branch --move old-branch-name new-branch-name
```

Push the renamed branch to the remote:

```bash
$ git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name
```

Delete the old branch from the remote:

```bash
$ git push origin --delete old-branch-name
```

## Changing the Master Branch Name
Rename the `master` branch to `main` locally:

```bash
$ git branch --move master main
```

Push the `main` branch to the remote:

```bash
$ git push --set-upstream origin main
```

Delete the `master` branch from the remote:

```bash
$ git push origin --delete master
```

### Additional Tasks
After renaming the branch, update:
- Dependencies
- Test-runner configurations
- Build/release scripts
- Repository default settings
- Documentation
- Pull requests targeting the old branch

Once everything is updated, ensure the `main` branch works correctly before deleting the `master` branch.
