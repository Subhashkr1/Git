# Branches in a Nutshell

To understand Git branching, we need to see how Git stores its data. Instead of changesets, Git stores snapshots of your project at each commit.

### How Git Stores Data
- When you make a commit, Git creates a commit object that:
  - Points to a snapshot of staged files.
  - Contains metadata (author, message, parent commits).
  - Tracks zero parents (initial commit), one parent (normal commit), or multiple parents (merge commits).

### Example of Commit Process
1. Stage files:
   ```bash
   git add README test.rb LICENSE
   ```
2. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'Initial commit'
   ```
   - Git creates:
     - Blobs (file contents).
     - A tree object (directory structure).
     - A commit object (snapshot pointer and metadata).

### Branch Basics
- A branch is a lightweight pointer to a commit.
- The default branch is `master` (or `main`).
- Commits move the branch pointer forward automatically.

#### Creating a New Branch
- Use `git branch` to create a branch:
  ```bash
  git branch testing
  ```
  - Creates a new branch pointer to the current commit.
  - HEAD still points to the current branch.

#### Switching Branches
- Use `git checkout` to switch branches:
  ```bash
  git checkout testing
  ```
  - Moves HEAD to the new branch.
  - Changes files in the working directory to match the branch.

### Diverging History
- Making changes on one branch and switching back creates divergent histories.
- Example:
  1. Make changes on `testing`:
     ```bash
     git commit -a -m 'Make a change'
     ```
  2. Switch to `master`:
     ```bash
     git checkout master
     ```
  3. Make other changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -a -m 'Make other changes'
     ```

### Visualizing Branches
- Use `git log` with options to see branch pointers and history:
  ```bash
  git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
  ```

### Efficient Branching in Git
- Branches are simple files storing commit checksums (40 bytes).
- Creating a branch is instant, unlike older VCS tools.
- Encourages frequent branching and merging.

### Tips
- Create and switch to a new branch in one step:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b new-branch
  ```
- Use `git switch` (Git 2.23+):
  ```bash
  git switch testing-branch
  git switch -c new-branch
  ```
